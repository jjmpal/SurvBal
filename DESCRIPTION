Title: Selection of Compositional Microbiome Balances for Survival
    Outcomes
Version: 0.1.0
Description: SurvBal enables the selection of microbiome balances in relation to censored
    survival and time-to-event outcomes which are of considerable
    interest, particularly in many biomedical studies. The most common Cox
    proportional hazards and standard parametric survival (including
    accelerated failure time) models are included in the package, which
    are used in combination with step-wise selection procedures to
    identify the optimal associated ratio of the geometric means of two
    groups of taxaâ€™s relative abundances.
